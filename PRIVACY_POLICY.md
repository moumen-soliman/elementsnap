# Privacy Policy

ElementSnap does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

This extension operates entirely within your browser and allows you to select DOM elements on webpages and copy their details (HTML, classes, IDs) to your clipboard. No data is transmitted to any external servers.

All functionality runs locally in your browser:
- Element selection and highlighting happens entirely on your device
- Element information is only copied to your clipboard when you explicitly click "Copy to Clipboard"
- No element data is stored, logged, or transmitted anywhere
- No analytics or tracking is implemented

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at moumensoliman@gmail.com.
